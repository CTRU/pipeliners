# pipeliners


Meant to be a quick small framework for creating pipelines in python. 
The library pipeliners.py handles the system calls and exits if something has gone wrong.

It is furthermore capable of delivering error messages from the failed programs, and terminate a script upon any error.


Libary:

pipeliners.py:


Programs: 

serial.py:

parallel.py:
